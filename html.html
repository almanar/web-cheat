    #charset

        Indicates the document's encoding.

        Very important document wide, so it must be within the first 512 bytes of the document.

        Keep your sanity and use UTF-8 *everywhere*.

    <!--
    The first line determines the document type.

    HTML5 has one single possibility:

        <!DOCTYPE html>

    HTML4 has others.

    <!--
    #link

        The link element links to different types of external documents.

        The `rel` attribute specifies what is the type.

        One notable exception of external document that is not referred to via
        link ref are scripts such as javascript, which must be referred to with
        script href [for some reason](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2631635/can-i-load-javascript-code-using-link-tag).

        <!--

    <p>Main HTML cheat.</p>
    <p>
        This only considers versions of HTML which are valid XML.
        Features which are inherited from XML shall not be discussed here.
    </p>

<h1>Standards</h1>

    <p>
        HTML is standardized by the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
        homepage <a href="http://www.w3.com">http://www.w3.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> website is not affiliated in any way to W3C.
        It is said that it contains many errors, and its certification is worthless:
        it is the cplusplus.com of the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        W3C has many important member organizations including companies, universities and others such as
        Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Adobe.
    </p>
    <p>W3C specifies many of the key web standards including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>DOM</li>
        <li>XML</li>
        <li>CGI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One important standard that they do <em>not</em> specify is Javascript.</p>
    <p>
        W3C have several levels of endorsement.
        - WD (Working Draf) is the lowest level of endorsement of material available to the public
        - REC (Recommendation) is the highest level, for stable and widely accepted features.
        - NOTES are possible to make small later revisions.
        - retired is for standards that have been deprecated
    </p>

    <h2>#HTML5</h2>

        <p>
            WD of 2008, expected REC for 2014: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5 standard</a>
            The huge time lapse is in part due to wars on the future of Flash replacement.
        <p>
        <p>
            Not all HTML5 is not XML, just pretty close to it.
            It is however possible to write HTML5 code that is valid XML.
            XHTML5 is a version of HTML5 which is always XML.
        <p>
        <p>HTML5 is not SGML, but it was influenced by it. HTML 4 is SGML.</p>

    <h2>#XHTML5</h2>

        <p>XHTML5 is a strictly XML version of HTML5.</p>
        <p>The standard is developed together with HTML5.</p>
        <p>
            Browsers differentiate between the two based on the HTTP content type:
            <code>text/html</code> is for HTML5 and <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> is for XHTML5.
            The <code>DOCTYPE</code> is not used to differentiate between HTML and XHTML.
        <p>

        <h3>XHTML5 vs HTML5</h3>

            <h4>End tags</h4>

                <p>
                    In XHTML5 all tags can be self-closing (e.g. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>).
                    All tags must be closed (self or not).
                    All tags can be either self-closing or not.
                <p>
                <p>In HTML5 things are much messier:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Void elements cannot have a separate end tag,
                        but they may have a meaningless slash <code>/</code>
                        added to them (<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#void-elements">spec</a>)
                        so the following are all valid: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foreign elements can be self closing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The other elements <em>cannot</em> be self closing.
                    </li>
                </ul>

    <h2>#validation</h2>

        <p>W3C offers an HTML validation service at: http://validator.w3.org/</p>
        <p>You can either upload your file, or give it an URL.</p>
        <p>
            There are also tools that make it faster to validate a page,
            for example the Firefox Web Developer extension.
        </p>

<h1>#debugging</h1>

    <p>In order to understand what is going on, you will want to use browser tools.</p>

    <h2>#firefox</h2>

        <p>Firefox has the built-in Web developers tool which is quite good.</p>

        <p>
            To validate HTML easily, try: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/
            Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + L
        </p>

<h1>#entities</h1>

    <p>Escape sequences for characters that are hard to input or forbidden such as the less than which is reserved for tags.</p>
    <p>nbsp: non breaking whitespace: a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b</p>
    <p>lt, gt: &lt; &gt;</p>

<h1>#attributes</h1>

    <p>
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1735230/can-i-add-custom-attribute-to-html-tag">Using non standard tags makes your document invalid</a>.
        It is still likely to render correctly on all browsers.
        You can also cheat this by referencing a custom !DOCTYPE declaration, but this is really overkill.
        HTML allows you to use any attribute prefixed by `data-`. Great addition!
    </p>

    <p>Double or single quotes are both OK:</p>

    <div data-val="attr"></div>
    <div data-val='attr'></div>
    <div data-val='"'></div>
    <div data-val="&quot;"></div>
    <div data-val="'"></div>
    <div data-val="&apos;"></div>

    <p>Id attributes must be unique across the entire document: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/127178/two-html-elements-with-same-id-attribute-how-bad-is-it-really</p>

    <p>Multiple classes are space separated as in: <code>"class0 class1 class2"</code></p>

<h1>#block vs #inline vs #inline-block #replaced elements</h1>

    <p>http://www.impressivewebs.com/difference-block-inline-css/</p>

    <p>You cannot put block elements inside inline elements, even if you use the CSS display property.</p>

    <p>
        Inline replaced elements such as images which behave like elements with CSS `display:inline-block` property.
        They can be put inside other inline elements.
    </p>

<h1>#anchor #link</h1>

    <a href="#href">link to destination</a>
    <p id="href">link destination</p>

    <p>
    #nofollow

        Has no special semantics to browsers,
        but may instruct users and search engines not to follow links.

        <a href="html2.html" rel="nofollow">rel="nofollow"</a>
    </p>

    <p>You cannot put one `a` inside another `a` in valid HTML5.</p>

    <div><div></div></div>

    <a href="html2.html">
        <span>p</span>
        <p>img: <img src="png.png" height="20" width="20" alt=""/></p>
        <!-- The innermost anchor wins the link direction: -->
    </a>

<h1>#img #images</h1>

    <p>img elements are neither inline nor block: they are replaced inline elements.</p>

    <img src="png.png" height="100" width="200" alt=""/>

    <p>
        What is the best way to set image size: CSS (width and height apply to replaced inline elements) or HTML?
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2414506/should-image-size-be-defined-in-the-img-tag-height-width-attributes-or-in-css
    </p>

    <h2>alt</h2>

        <p>If:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an image does not exist</li>
            <li>the format is not supported by the browser (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Image_format_support">support list</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>then alt the browser can show the alt text instead of the image.</p>
        <p>
            As of 2013, chrome replaces a missing image with a dummy image, therefore ignoring alt.
            Therefore don't rely on alt being shown in your app logic: alt should only be shown
            in case of error.
            If an image should not present, replace it with something else explicitly.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the HTML5 validator, alt is mandatory except under certain conditions,
            so just use it always for your sanity.
        </p>
        <!--INVALID:-->
        <!--<img src="i_dont_exist.format_not_supported"/>-->
        <p>With alt text:</p>
        <img src="i_dont_exist.format_not_supported" alt="alt text"/>

    <h2>legend caption</h2>

        <p>
            fig + figcaption is good practice in HTML5.

            figcaption has no special display,
            it is only semantic and the real work must be done with css.

            Browsers may however place it in a sensible place such as the bottom if no style data is found.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="png.png" height="50" width="50"/>
            <figcaption>caption 0</figcaption>
        </figure>

<h1>#table</h1>

    <p>Header with th:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>head 0</th>
            <th>head 1</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>#thead, #tbody and #tfoot</h2>
        <p>thead must come *before* tbody and tfoot in valid HTML, as any sane programmer should do.</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>head 0</th>
                    <th>head 1</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tfoot>
                <tr>
                    <td>foot 0</td>
                    <td>foot 1</td>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>body 0</td>
                    <td>body 1</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

    <h2>#caption</h2>

        <p>Caption must be the first child of table.</p>

        <p>Caption default position:</p>
        <table>
            <caption>caption 0</caption>
            <tr>
                <td>body 0</td>
                <td>body 1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Caption on bottom. The `align` attribute is not in HTML5 (deprecated in 4.01). Use CSS `caption-side` instead.</p>
        <table>
            <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">caption 0</caption>
            <tr>
                <td>body 0</td>
                <td>body 1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

<h1>#code</h1>

    <p>Inline element for computer code.</p>

    <p>Does not imply whitespace preservation:</p>

    <p><code>a
b</code></p>

    <p>Common combo with <code>pre</code> to preserve spaces and make it a block element:</p>

    <pre><code>a
b</code></pre>

    <p>My preferred solution: just use <code>code</code> and CSS:</p>

    <code style="white-space:pre;display:block">a
b</code>

    <code style="white-space:pre;display:block">a
b</code>

<h1>#pre</h1>

    <p>White spaces are taken into consideration when rendering.</p>

    <p>
        I think that this is a bad tag because it implies style rather than meaning
        and style should be left for CSS, and it can in this case via <code>white-space:pre</code>.
        The only difference is that <code>pre</code> ignores the first character if it is a newline,
        while <code>white-space:pre</code> does not.
    </p>

    <p><code>pre</code> :</p>

    <pre>a
 b
    </pre>

    <p>Same as:</p>

    <pre>
a
 b
    </pre>

    <p><code>white-space:pre</code> :</p>

    <div style="white-space:pre">
a
 b
    </div>
