## W3C

WWW Consortium.

W3C specifies many of the key web standards including:

- HTML: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/>
- CSS: <http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/> and other pages
- DOM: <http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/>
- XML: <http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/>
- CGI

One important web standard that they **do not** specify is Javascript, which is specified by Ecma international <http://www.ecma-international.org/>

W3C has many important member organizations including companies, universities and others such as Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Adobe.

### Maturity levels of standards

W3C has several levels of endorsement for standards. They are described on the "Process" document: <http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#maturity-levels>.

-   **ED** (Editor's Draft):  recent version the editor is working on. No formal endorsement, updated often. <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6692762/what-is-the-difference-between-a-w3c-working-draft-and-an-editors-draft>

-   **WD** (Working Draft): lowest level of endorsement of material available to the public

-   **CR** (Candidate Recommendation): higher

-   **PR** (Proposed Recommendation): higher

-   **REC** (Recommendation): highest level, for stable and widely accepted features

-   **Working group note**: TODO

-   **NOTES**: make small revisions to a standard

-   **retired**: standards that have been deprecated

### Versions

Like any decent document, W3C standards are have versions, and it is possible to link either to a branch or specific version of the document.

The initial paragraph of the documents always contains links to:

- latest stable version: `http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/`
- bleeding edge version, AKA "editor's draft": `http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html`
- specific versions: `http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/archives/20140617/webrtc.html`

Link to the one that makes most sense.

## WHATWG

Specs group, split from W3C because they disagreed: <http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#WHATWG_and_the_W3C_HTML_WG>

Started by Mozilla, Apple and Safari. <http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_the_WHATWG.3F>

Claim to be more practical oriented.

W3C tries to keep in touch, e.g. HTML5 has on WHATWG editor.

## IETF

Internet Engineering Task Force.

Specifies mainly networking protocols, in particular HTTP, which is used at many points of W3C documentation, so will not be covered here.

For an HTTP tutorial see: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/net/http.md>
