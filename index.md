# Standards organizations

## W3C

WWW Consortium.

W3C specifies many of the key web standards including:

- HTML: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/>
- CSS:  <http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/> and other pages
- DOM:  <http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/>
- XML:  <http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/>
- CGI

One important web standard that they **do not** specify is Javascript, which is specified by Ecma international <http://www.ecma-international.org/>

W3C has many important member organizations including companies, universities and others such as Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Adobe.

W3C has several levels of endorsement for standards:

- WD (Working Draft):   lowest level of endorsement of material available to the public
- REC (Recommendation): highest level, for stable and widely accepted features
- NOTES:                make small revisions to a standard
- retired:              standards that have been deprecated

## IETF

Specifies networking protocols, in particular HTTP, which is used at many points of W3C documentation.

Such protocols shall not be covered here.
