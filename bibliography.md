Non standard sources

1. [Mozilla's MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org): an open wiki with highly recommended content. Huge amount of content, examples, depth and implementation status. Their HTML5 front page beautifully summarizes the main themes on HTML5: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/Guide/HTML/HTML5>
1. [Web Platform Docs WPD](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page): wiki with tutorials
1. [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/): amazing CSS source. Create and maintained by Chris Coyier <http://chriscoyier.net/>, now has articles by many. Very high quality techniques. Closed source apparently.
1. [HTML5 rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/): new web technologies in general, not just HTML: CSS, JavaScript, server side, etc. Google sponsored. [Open source](https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com).
1. [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com) fine for beginners, but not open source, and thus cannot update fast enough, so may contain errors and has been criticized by many devs. Tutorials are a bit shallow. Insane Google rank, which makes may devs mad.
1. [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/): similar to HTML5 rocks, but 6 guys from famous web related companies. Lots of examples.

## Implementation status trackers

1. [All modernizr tests](http://modernizr.github.io/Modernizr/test/), cross referenced to Can I use.
1. [Can I use](http://caniuse.com/).
